Most builders only know the first 3.

**AI-NATIVE — The New Stack**

**1\. Firecrawl**125,000 stars. Turns any URL into clean markdown or structured JSON in one call. Handles JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, and dynamic content automatically. Has a native Claude MCP integration so your agent can scrape anything without leaving your workflow. [github.com/mendableai/firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl)

**2\. Crawl4AI**66,000 stars. Built specifically for LLM pipelines. Extracts clean structured data automatically and outputs it in formats Claude and other models can reason across directly. No cleaning required on the other end. [github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)

**3\. Browser Use**Gives AI agents full browser control. Your Claude agent can navigate, click, fill forms, and extract data from any site without you writing a single scraping rule. The closest thing to giving Claude hands. [github.com/browser-use/browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)

**4\. Stagehand**TypeScript-native browser automation built on Playwright. Tell it what to do in plain English: "click the login button," "extract the price." It figures out the selectors itself. Built for production agent workflows. [github.com/browserbase/stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand)

**5\. Skyvern**Takes a screenshot and feeds it to a vision model instead of parsing the DOM. No selectors. No XPath. No breaking when a site redesigns. Scored 85.85% on WebVoyager. Especially strong on form-heavy sites that break selector-based scrapers. [github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern)

**6\. ScrapeGraph AI**Give it a natural language instruction. It navigates the site, understands the page context, and returns structured data. No selectors ever written. Built for anyone who wants to skip the engineering entirely. [github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/Scrapegraph-ai](https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/Scrapegraph-ai)

**7\. AgentQL**A query language built specifically for AI agents to interact with web pages. Instead of brittle CSS selectors that break on every redesign, you describe what you want semantically. The query finds it regardless of how the underlying markup changes. [github.com/tinyfish-io/agentql](https://github.com/tinyfish-io/agentql)

**ANTI-DETECTION — Built to Survive**

**8\. Hyperbrowser**Stealth headless browser for AI agents. Drop-in Playwright replacement that bypasses Cloudflare, DataDome, and bot detection by default. If your current scraper is hitting walls on protected domains, this is the first swap to make. [github.com/hyperbrowserai/hyperbrowser](https://github.com/hyperbrowserai/hyperbrowser)

**9\. Crawlee**Playwright and Puppeteer wrapped in a framework with built-in anti-detection. Handles fingerprinting, headless detection, and rate limiting automatically. The default choice for JavaScript and TypeScript teams who need one stack for both HTTP and browser-based scraping. [github.com/apify/crawlee](https://github.com/apify/crawlee)

**10\. Scrapling**Built specifically for the hard case: scale with proxy rotation, adaptive selectors, and anti-bot bypass all in one package. When a site updates its structure, Scrapling adapts. When an IP gets flagged, it rotates. Confirmed active 2026 development. [github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling](https://github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling)

**11\. Steel**Open-source browser API and sandbox built for AI agents. Managed browser sessions with authentication persistence, anti-detection, and debugging tools built in. Handles the infrastructure complexity of running browsers at scale so your agent code does not have to. [github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser)

**12\. Playwright**Microsoft's browser automation library. The one tool that reliably handles JavaScript-heavy sites that break everything else. Default to this for DOM-driven tasks. 12 to 17 percentage points more reliable than vision-driven tools for the 80% of tasks where DOM is accessible. [github.com/microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)

**PRODUCTION SCALE — Battle-Tested**

**13\. Scrapy**52,000 stars. The Python framework that has been running production scrapers longer than most of these tools have existed. Async, middleware pipelines, built-in export. Still the most reliable option at genuine scale. [github.com/scrapy/scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

**14\. Puppeteer**Google's Node.js browser automation library. Massive ecosystem, extensive documentation, deep integration with the Chrome DevTools Protocol. The standard reference for the Node.js stack. [github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

**15\. Selenium**The original. Still actively maintained with 2026 commits. Supports every major language and browser. The most universally supported option when you need to run on infrastructure that does not allow newer tools. [github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium)

**16\. Colly**Go-based scraping framework. Extremely fast, concurrent by default, and built for high-throughput crawl jobs where Python's overhead becomes the bottleneck. The right choice when speed is the constraint. [github.com/gocolly/colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly)

**SPECIALIST TOOLS — One Job, Done Right**

**17\. Katana**Fast reconnaissance crawler built for complex site architectures. Handles nested paths, dynamic routes, and JavaScript endpoints that simpler crawlers miss entirely. Built by security researchers who needed a crawler that never stops at the surface. [github.com/projectdiscovery/katana](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana)

**18\. Browserless**Managed Chrome and Firefox instances with Playwright and Puppeteer compatibility. Automatic scaling, session recording, and anti-detection built in. Used by thousands of companies to run browser automation without managing their own browser infrastructure. [github.com/browserless/browserless](https://github.com/browserless/browserless)

**19\. Maxun**No-code scraping platform. Point it at a site, show it what data you want, and it builds the scraper for you. Zero lines of code. Built for operators who need data pipelines without engineering. [github.com/getmaxun/maxun](https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun)

**20\. Heritrix**The Apache Foundation's institutional-grade web crawler. Built for massive crawl jobs at a scale that would overwhelm every other tool on this list. Used by the Internet Archive. When the task is crawling millions of pages reliably, this is the architecture. [github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3)

The scraping problem in 2026 is not writing the code.

It is surviving Cloudflare, DataDome, Kasada, and PerimeterX. The anti-bot market hit $11 billion in 2025 and these systems now block well-built in-house scrapers within seconds on protected domains.

Every repo above was built knowing that. Most scrapers people write from scratch were not.
